A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I would like to add new fields on to the Note Form Widget consisting of type double, the two extra fields should take double values from the user
send it to the db(the same way title and description does.  ).  After which I should be able to call those two values and do some calculations with them.  
The result should be displayed on the note detail page along with the current title and description, simple addition and multiplication should suffice.
